## ðŸ”§ Deployment Process

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment**
1. **Run Pre-Deployment Checks**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh --check
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Check Railway configuration
   railway vars
   railway status
   ```

3. **Test Health Endpoints Locally**
   ```bash
   npm start
   curl http://localhost:3003/health
   ```

### **Phase 2: Deployment**
1. **Deploy to Railway**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment Progress**
   ```bash
   railway logs --follow
   ```

3. **Verify Health Checks**
   ```bash
   # Automatic health check included in deploy script
   # Or manually check:
   curl https://your-domain.railway.app/health
   ```

### **Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation**
1. **Functional Testing**
   - [ ] MCP server responds to requests
   - [ ] GA4 API integration working
   - [ ] Authentication system functional
   - [ ] All 6 MCP tools operational:
     - [ ] `query_analytics`
     - [ ] `get_realtime_data`
     - [ ] `get_traffic_sources`
     - [ ] `get_user_demographics`
     - [ ] `get_page_performance`
     - [ ] `get_conversion_data`

2. **Performance Validation**
   - [ ] Response times within acceptable limits
   - [ ] Memory usage stable
   - [ ] No memory leaks detected
   - [ ] GA4 API quota usage reasonable

3. **Monitoring Validation**
   - [ ] Health dashboard accessible
   - [ ] Logs being generated and rotated
   - [ ] Error tracking functional
   - [ ] APM traces being collected
   - [ ] GA4 metrics being recorded

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedures

### **Immediate Rollback**
If critical issues are detected:
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh --emergency
```

### **Manual Rollback**
For specific deployment rollback:
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh --list
./scripts/rollback.sh [DEPLOYMENT_ID]
```

### **Health Check Failure**
If health checks fail:
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify environment variables: `railway vars`
3. Check resource usage: `railway usage`
4. Consider rollback if issues persist

### **Performance Issues**
If performance degrades:
1. Monitor resource usage
2. Check GA4 API quota limits
3. Review error tracking dashboard
4. Scale resources if needed
5. Implement emergency rate limiting
