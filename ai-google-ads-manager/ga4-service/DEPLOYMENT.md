railway variables set GOOGLE_OAUTH_SCOPES="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly"

# Google Cloud Service Account
railway variables set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./ga4-service-account.json"
```

**Optional Performance Variables:**
```bash
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000

```

### 4. Upload Service Account File
```bash
# Method 1: Via Railway dashboard (Recommended)
# 1. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí Variables
# 2. Upload ga4-service-account.json as a file variable
# 3. Set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the file path

# Method 2: Via CLI (if supported)
railway variables set --file ga4-service-account.json
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the comprehensive deployment script
npm run deploy:production

# Or run manually:
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# 1. Validate local environment
npm run validate

# 2. Run security checks
npm run security:check

# 3. Deploy to Railway
railway up

# 4. Monitor deployment
railway logs --follow

# 5. Test deployment
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health
```

## üîí Security Configuration

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] **Strong API Keys**: Use 32+ character random keys
- [ ] **HTTPS Only**: All URLs must use HTTPS
- [ ] **CORS Configured**: Only allow your frontend domains
- [ ] **No Debug Logs**: Set LOG_LEVEL=info in production
- [ ] **Service Account**: Properly uploaded and secured
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Enabled and configured
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error middleware
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Alerts configured for errors and uptime

### Security Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive security check
node scripts/security-check.js

# Expected output for production:
# ‚úÖ Security Score: 95+/100
# ‚úÖ 0 CRITICAL issues
# ‚úÖ Ready for deployment
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check service status
railway status

# View real-time logs
railway logs --follow

# Check specific log timeframe
railway logs --since 1h
```

### Key Endpoints to Monitor
- **Health Check**: `https://your-service.railway.app/health`
- **Auth Status**: `https://your-service.railway.app/auth/status`
- **Token Health**: `https://your-service.railway.app/auth/token/health`

### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Service metrics
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "features": {
    "oauth2": true,
    "tokenRefresh": true,
    "autoRefresh": true,
    "tokenCache": true
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Authentication Failures
```bash
# Check OAuth configuration
curl https://your-service.railway.app/auth/status

# Verify Supabase settings
railway variables get SUPABASE_URL
railway variables get SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

#### 2. GA4 API Connection Issues
```bash
# Test service account
railway variables get GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

# Check GA4 endpoint
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" https://your-service.railway.app/api/ga4/health
```

#### 3. Rate Limiting Issues
```bash
# Check rate limit configuration
railway variables get RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS
railway variables get RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS

# Monitor rate limit headers in responses
curl -I https://your-service.railway.app/api/ga4/health
```

#### 4. Token Management Issues
```bash
# Check token health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  https://your-service.railway.app/auth/token/health

# Clear token cache
curl -X DELETE https://your-service.railway.app/auth/cache
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Rollback Deployment
```bash
# View deployment history
railway deployments

# Rollback to previous version
railway rollback <deployment-id>
```

#### Security Incident Response
```bash
# 1. Immediately rotate API keys
railway variables set GA4_API_KEY="new-secure-key"

# 2. Clear all token caches
curl -X DELETE https://your-service.railway.app/auth/cache

# 3. Review logs for suspicious activity
railway logs --since 24h | grep "ERROR\|WARN"

# 4. Update CORS if needed
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://new-domain.com"
```

## üìà Scaling & Performance

### Auto-scaling Configuration
The service includes auto-scaling configuration in `railway.json`:
- **Min Instances**: 1
- **Max Instances**: 5
- **CPU Target**: 70%
- **Memory Target**: 80%

### Performance Optimization
- **Token Caching**: 2-minute TTL reduces API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against abuse
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Health Checks**: 30-second timeout for reliability
