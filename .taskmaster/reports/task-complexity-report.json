			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by breaking down each integration and state management concern into atomic, testable units. Include subtasks for: (1) Supabase-MCP authentication handshake, (2) secure credential storage and rotation, (3) state context refactoring, (4) permission and error handling, (5) offline/connection fallback, (6) session lifecycle management, (7) multi-property context and switching, (8) state synchronization and race condition handling, (9) comprehensive integration testing, and (10) documentation and developer handoff.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating two authentication systems, secure credential management, complex state synchronization, multi-property support, and robust error/permission handling. Each area introduces significant branching logic, security considerations, and cross-cutting concerns, resulting in high cyclomatic and cognitive complexity[1][2][3]. The current 8 subtasks are well-structured but could be further decomposed to ensure atomicity, testability, and maintainability, especially given the high priority and risk profile."
