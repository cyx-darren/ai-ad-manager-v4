			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the GA4 API data integration into granular subtasks for each dashboard component (metric cards, donut charts, campaign tables, advanced analytics), including: endpoint mapping, data transformation, error handling, quota management, authentication, caching, UI state management, security, performance optimization, and modular test coverage. Ensure each subtask aligns with best practices for scalable, secure, and maintainable API integrations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves phased integration of a third-party analytics API into multiple dashboard components, requiring robust error handling, quota management, secure authentication, data transformation, and UI feedback. It must address cross-cutting concerns (security, caching, performance, modularity) and coordinate with other features. The breadth of integration, need for resilience, and adherence to industry best practices (modular code, secure token handling, scalable data fetching, and comprehensive testing) make this a highly complex task, warranting further decomposition into at least 10 focused subtasks for effective implementation and maintainability."
