			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the dashboard UI build into granular subtasks for each major component (layout, navigation, metric cards, charts, widgets, state management, date selector, responsiveness, loading/error handling, settings, refresh). For each, specify UI/UX requirements, integration points, and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves building a feature-rich, interactive dashboard with multiple custom components, state management, data visualization, and responsive design. It requires integration with external APIs, robust error handling, and user customization. The breadth of UI elements and the need for maintainability and testability make this a high-complexity task, best managed by decomposing into at least 10 focused subtasks aligned with industry best practices for modular, testable UI development."
