		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Supabase Cloud Instance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase Cloud configuration into granular steps: project creation, schema migration, authentication setup, RLS policy implementation, storage configuration, Edge Functions deployment, Realtime setup, database optimization, backup/disaster recovery, and monitoring/alerting. For each, specify required tools, security best practices, and validation steps.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple critical production setup steps, each with security, performance, and reliability implications. It requires expertise in cloud infrastructure, database migration, authentication, security policies, and operational monitoring. Each area (e.g., RLS, storage, Edge Functions) is a distinct domain, justifying a high complexity score and a need for detailed subtasks to ensure best practices and minimize risk."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Local Supabase Instance for Development",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the local Supabase setup into subtasks: prerequisites installation, CLI setup, project initialization, schema creation, RLS policy setup, Auth provider configuration, Realtime channel setup, seed data creation, client library integration, migration script setup, and documentation. For each, include validation and troubleshooting steps.",
			"reasoning": "While local development setup is less risky than production, it still spans multiple domains: environment setup, schema design, security, authentication, and developer tooling. Each step can introduce issues if not handled carefully, especially with RLS and Auth. The process benefits from clear, isolated subtasks for maintainability and onboarding."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Database Schema for Core Entities",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose schema creation into: entity modeling, migration script authoring, RLS policy definition, index and constraint setup, trigger/function implementation, ERD documentation, and schema validation/testing. For each, specify review and rollback procedures.",
			"reasoning": "Designing and implementing a robust, secure, and performant schema for multiple interrelated entities is complex. It requires careful planning for relationships, constraints, security, and future extensibility. Each aspect (migrations, RLS, triggers, documentation) is a significant effort and should be isolated for quality and review."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy Frontend to Vercel",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down frontend deployment into: production build optimization, environment variable configuration, error/analytics setup, Vercel project/repo connection, build settings configuration, domain/SSL setup, preview deployment configuration, Edge Functions setup, monitoring/alerting, and CI/CD pipeline creation.",
			"reasoning": "Modern frontend deployment involves several moving parts: build optimization, environment management, integration with Vercel features, and CI/CD. While Vercel abstracts much, ensuring a secure, performant, and observable deployment still requires attention to detail and several discrete steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Implementation Roadmap Generator",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the roadmap generator into: algorithm design, service implementation, task data modeling, calendar API integration, scheduling logic, dependency management, progress tracking, notification system, and analytics/reporting. For each, define interface contracts and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines algorithmic logic (task sequencing, impact estimation), integration (calendar API), data modeling, and user-facing features (notifications, analytics). Each area is non-trivial and requires careful design to ensure usability, correctness, and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Team Collaboration Features",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose collaboration features into: data model design, backend service implementation, comment system UI, dashboard sharing, task assignment, activity feed, notification system, @mentions, collaborative filtering, and team analytics. For each, specify access control and real-time update requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Team collaboration spans backend, frontend, and real-time systems, with complex data relationships and permissions. Each feature (comments, sharing, notifications) is a substantial module, and real-time updates plus access control add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Reporting System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down reporting system into: architecture design, report template system, scheduling engine, export format implementation, backend service, report builder UI, template library, scheduling UI, sharing capabilities, analytics dashboard, custom metric configuration, and notification system.",
			"reasoning": "A robust reporting system requires backend and frontend coordination, template management, scheduling, export, and analytics. Each area is a significant engineering effort, and the system must be extensible, reliable, and secure, justifying a high complexity score and detailed subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Landing Page Intelligence UI",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand UI implementation into: component design, data fetching integration, score visualization, screenshot preview, recommendation cards, before/after visualization, page comparison, historical tracking, manual crawl trigger, and bulk analysis. For each, include accessibility and responsive design checks.",
			"reasoning": "This UI aggregates complex analysis data, requires multiple visualization types, and must support comparison and historical tracking. Integration with backend analysis and ensuring a seamless, accessible user experience increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Implement End-to-End Testing and Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose QA into: E2E framework setup, core test suites (auth, dashboard, analytics, recommendations, landing page), integration tests, performance/load testing, accessibility testing, security testing, visual regression, CI integration, user acceptance testing, bug tracking, test documentation, and reporting.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive QA covers multiple test types (E2E, integration, performance, security, accessibility, visual), CI integration, and user acceptance. Each area is a discipline in itself, and together they form a critical, highly complex foundation for product reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Build Implementation Roadmap UI",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand UI build into: roadmap component design, Gantt chart implementation, dependency visualization, progress tracking, calendar integration, filtering, detail modal, editing, commenting, export, notification preferences, reminder system, template library, and automation suggestions.",
			"reasoning": "This UI requires advanced visualization (Gantt, dependencies), interactive editing, and integration with scheduling and notification systems. Each feature is substantial, and the UI must be intuitive and performant, warranting a detailed breakdown."
