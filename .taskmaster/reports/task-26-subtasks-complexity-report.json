			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the MCP Server Setup & All Tools task into granular subtasks covering: project scaffolding, dependency management, authentication integration, GA4 API client abstraction, individual tool implementations (one per GA4 tool), error handling, logging/monitoring, environment configuration, deployment automation, and post-deployment validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves full-stack server setup, secure authentication, integration with multiple external APIs (GA4), reusable utility development, production deployment, and robust testing. The breadth (infrastructure, security, analytics, deployment) and depth (six distinct analytics tools, shared utilities, error handling, monitoring) make it highly complex. Industry best practices recommend modularizing each major concern (auth, API, each tool, deployment, monitoring) to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability. The current five subtasks are high-level; further decomposition (especially splitting each GA4 tool and deployment steps) is needed for clarity, parallelization, and risk mitigation."
