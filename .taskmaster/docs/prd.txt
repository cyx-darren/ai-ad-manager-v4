# AI Google Ads Manager SaaS - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The AI Google Ads Manager is an intelligent SaaS platform designed to automate and optimize Google Ads campaign management by replacing traditional human advertising agencies with AI-powered insights and recommendations. The platform leverages Google Analytics data via MCP (Model Context Protocol), performs deep landing page analysis, and provides actionable recommendations with implementation roadmaps.

**Problem Statement:** Small to medium businesses struggle with the complexity and cost of Google Ads management, often paying expensive agency fees for suboptimal results. Manual campaign optimization is time-consuming and requires expertise that many businesses lack.

**Target Audience:** 
- Small to medium business owners running Google Ads
- Marketing managers seeking to reduce agency costs
- Digital marketing teams wanting AI-powered optimization
- Agencies looking to scale their operations

**Value Proposition:** Delivers agency-level Google Ads expertise at a fraction of the cost through AI automation, providing real-time optimization recommendations, comprehensive performance analysis, and step-by-step implementation guidance.

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Performance Dashboard âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**What it does:** Provides a comprehensive, visually engaging overview of Google Ads campaigns and website performance through interactive metric cards, data visualizations, and campaign analysis tables.

**Why it's important:** Users need immediate visibility into campaign performance to make data-driven decisions quickly without navigating multiple Google interfaces.

**Implementation Status:** **COMPLETED** - Full dashboard with 8 metric cards, 4 donut charts, and interactive campaign table.

**Current Features:**
- **8 Key Performance Metric Cards:**
  - Total Campaigns (12)
  - Total Impressions (45,678) 
  - Click Rate (3.2%)
  - Total Sessions (8,234)
  - Total Users (6,543)
  - Avg Bounce Rate (42.5%)
  - Conversions (234)
  - Total Spend ($2,456 - mock data)

- **4 Interactive Donut Charts (2x2 responsive grid):**
  - Traffic Source Distribution - Sessions by source (8,200 total)
  - Device Breakdown - Traffic by device type (9,200 total)
  - Campaign Type Performance - Clicks by campaign type (3,380 total)
  - Geographic Distribution - Traffic by country (10,200 total)

### 2. Campaign Deep Dive Analysis
**What it does:** Enables granular analysis of Google Ads traffic within Google Analytics data, providing AI-powered insights on user behavior and conversion paths.

**Why it's important:** Understanding how Google Ads traffic behaves on your website is crucial for optimization, but Google Analytics interface is complex and time-consuming to navigate.

**How it works:**
- Filters Google Analytics data to show only Google Ads traffic
- Analyzes user behavior metrics: pages per session, bounce rate, session duration
- Tracks conversion paths and drop-off points
- Compares Google Ads traffic performance to other channels
- Identifies top-performing landing pages from ads

### 3. Landing Page Intelligence
**What it does:** Automatically crawls and analyzes landing pages to identify conversion optimization opportunities.

**Why it's important:** Landing page quality directly impacts Quality Score and conversion rates, but most advertisers lack the technical expertise to optimize effectively.

**How it works:**
- Uses Firecrawl MCP to analyze landing page content and structure
- Evaluates page speed, mobile responsiveness, and content relevance
- Checks alignment between ad copy and landing page messaging
- Generates specific recommendations for improvement

### 4. AI Recommendations Engine
**What it does:** Provides actionable, prioritized recommendations for campaign optimization with expected impact projections.

**Why it's important:** Users need expert-level guidance on what to change and why, replacing the strategic thinking typically provided by agencies.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes historical performance data to identify patterns
- Uses LLM to generate contextual recommendations
- Prioritizes actions based on potential impact and effort required
- Provides detailed explanations for each recommendation

### 5. Implementation Roadmap Generator
**What it does:** Creates step-by-step action plans with calendar integration for executing optimization recommendations.

**Why it's important:** Having great recommendations is useless without a clear plan for implementation - users need structured guidance on execution.

**How it works:**
- Converts recommendations into actionable tasks
- Sequences tasks based on dependencies and priorities
- Estimates time requirements and impact for each task
- Integrates with calendar systems for scheduling

### 6. Multi-Tenant Platform (Future Enhancement)
**What it does:** Enables agencies and teams to manage multiple client accounts with role-based access control.

**Why it's important:** Scaling the platform requires supporting multiple users and accounts while maintaining data security and separation.

**How it works:**
- Separate data schemas for each tenant
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Viewer)
- Client-specific dashboards and reports
- Centralized billing and user management
