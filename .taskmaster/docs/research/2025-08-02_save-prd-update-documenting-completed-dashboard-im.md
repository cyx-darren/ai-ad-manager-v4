# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Save PRD update documenting completed dashboard implementation to research files

**Response:**

The updated PRD documenting the completed dashboard implementation should be saved to your research files directory to ensure version control, traceability, and accessibility for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. For this project, the most appropriate location is within your Git repository under `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`, as this aligns with best practices for technical documentation management and supports your team's workflow[1].

---

## Recommended Documentation Practices

### 1. **Location and Version Control**
- **Git Repository**: Storing the PRD in `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` leverages Git's version control, making it easy to track changes, collaborate, and revert if needed[1].
- **Accessibility**: While Git is ideal for technical teams, consider linking to this file from user-facing documentation or dashboards for broader accessibility if needed[1].

### 2. **Documentation Structure**
Based on industry best practices, your PRD update should include:
- **Status Indicators**: Clearly mark implemented features (e.g., âœ… IMPLEMENTED) and completed phases for transparency[1].
- **Feature List**: Detail all dashboard elements (metric cards, donut charts, campaign table) to provide a comprehensive feature inventory[3].
- **Technical Implementation**: Document completed tasks, responsive design details, component usage (e.g., Tremor), and mock data architecture for future reference and onboarding[1].
- **Next Steps**: Outline upcoming phases, such as GA4 API integration, to maintain a clear project roadmap[1].

### 3. **Clarity and Context**
- **Audience Awareness**: Tailor documentation to both technical and business stakeholders by balancing technical depth with clear explanations of business value and user impact[3].
- **Contextual Details**: Include usage scenarios, data sources, and any assumptions or limitations to help future readers understand the dashboard's purpose and constraints[2][4].

## Actionable Steps for Your Project

1. **Save the Updated PRD**: Commit the revised `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` to your repository with a descriptive commit message (e.g., `docs: update PRD for completed dashboard implementation`).
2. **Reference in Related Tasks**: Link or reference the updated PRD in ongoing and future tasks (e.g., Multi-Tenant Architecture, Deep Dive Analysis View) to ensure alignment with the documented implementation and roadmap.
3. **Maintain Documentation Consistency**: As new features (like GA4 API integration) are implemented, continue updating the PRD to reflect changes, following the same structured approach.
4. **Consider User-Facing Summaries**: If non-technical stakeholders need access, provide a summary or link to the PRD from a more accessible platform (e.g., Notion, Confluence, or a dashboard help section)[1].

## Example Commit Workflow

```bash
git add .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt
git commit -m "docs: update PRD for completed dashboard implementation (dashboard features, technical details, next steps)"
git push
```

---

By following these practices, your PRD will serve as a reliable, up-to-date reference for all team members and stakeholders, supporting both current development and future enhancements[1][3][4].
