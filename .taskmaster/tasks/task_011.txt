# Task ID: 11
# Title: Integrate LLM for AI Recommendations Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the AI Recommendations Engine using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate contextual, actionable recommendations for campaign optimization.
# Details:
1. Set up LLM integration service on Railway:
   - Configure OpenAI API client (using gpt-4-turbo or equivalent)
   - Set up Claude API as fallback (Anthropic Claude 3 Opus or equivalent)
   - Implement prompt engineering for marketing recommendations
   - Create caching system for similar queries
2. Design recommendation generation system:
   - Create prompt templates for different recommendation types
   - Implement context gathering from GA4 data
   - Design recommendation scoring algorithm
   - Create recommendation categorization system
3. Implement recommendation storage and retrieval in Supabase
4. Create recommendation prioritization algorithm
5. Implement recommendation explanation generation
6. Add expected impact calculation for recommendations
7. Create recommendation implementation steps
8. Implement recommendation feedback system
9. Add recommendation history tracking
10. Create recommendation testing framework

# Test Strategy:
1. Test LLM integration with sample GA4 data
2. Verify recommendation generation with different campaign scenarios
3. Test recommendation scoring with various performance issues
4. Validate recommendation storage and retrieval
5. Test recommendation prioritization with multiple recommendations
6. Verify explanation generation for clarity
7. Test impact calculation with historical data
8. Validate implementation steps for actionability
9. Test feedback system with user ratings
10. Verify recommendation history tracking
