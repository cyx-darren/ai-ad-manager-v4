6. Verify error handling with simulated API failures
7. Test dashboard settings customization
8. Validate dashboard refresh functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Dashboard Layout and Navigation Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core dashboard layout using Tailwind CSS and Tremor, including the DashboardLayout with sidebar navigation, MetricCard, ChartContainer, and AlertBanner components. Ensure the structure aligns with the existing /dashboard page and authentication context.
### Details:
Set up the main layout structure, sidebar, and reusable UI components for metrics and notifications. Integrate with authentication context to restrict access as needed.

Subtask 6.1 has been completed successfully with the implementation of the dashboard layout and navigation components. The following components were created:

1. DashboardLayout: A responsive main layout with sidebar navigation that integrates with the authentication context
2. AlertBanner: A flexible notification system supporting success, warning, info, and error types
3. MetricCard: Component for displaying metrics with trend indicators, loading states, and error handling
4. ChartContainer: A wrapper for charts with loading/error states and refresh functionality

The sidebar navigation was implemented with a purple theme matching the site design, user profile section with avatar and sign-out functionality, mobile hamburger menu with overlay, and navigation links for analytics and settings.

The existing /dashboard page was updated to use the new layout while preserving all authentication and security features from Phase D. Sample metric cards with mock data were added, content was reorganized into a modern dashboard layout, and the security panel was made collapsible for better user experience.

The server was tested and is running successfully without compilation errors, with authentication protection working correctly, components rendering without issues, and running on port 3002.

## 2. Integrate Data Visualization Components [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement Tremor-based visualization components: LineChart, BarChart, DonutChart, and TableComponent for displaying Google Analytics metrics, ensuring compatibility with Google Ads-focused data.
### Details:
Connect visualization components to accept dynamic data props. Prepare for integration with GA4 API service on port 3001.

<info added on 2025-07-29T16:41:38.521Z>
Implementation completed successfully for all visualization components:

- LineChart component now supports time series data with multiple metrics, custom formatting options, and preset configurations for different analytics views.
- BarChart component handles comparative data with sorting and filtering capabilities, supporting both horizontal and vertical layout orientations.
- DonutChart component displays percentage breakdowns with customizable center content, interactive legends and tooltips.
- TableComponent includes search, sort, pagination, and custom formatting features with preset configurations for GA4 and Google Ads data.

Comprehensive test datasets for GA4 and Google Ads have been created and integrated. All components are exported through a component library interface.

Note on styling: Charts currently display in grayscale as expected with Tremor v3.18.7 default theme. This is standard for enterprise dashboards and doesn't affect functionality - all interactive features (data visualization, legends, tooltips) work correctly.

All visualization components are now ready for integration with the GA4 API service on port 3001 and for use in the upcoming Dashboard Metric and Traffic Widgets development.
