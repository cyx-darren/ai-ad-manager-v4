The following components were created:\n\n1. DashboardLayout: A responsive main layout with sidebar navigation that integrates with the authentication context\n2. AlertBanner: A flexible notification system supporting success, warning, info, and error types\n3. MetricCard: Component for displaying metrics with trend indicators, loading states, and error handling\n4. ChartContainer: A wrapper for charts with loading/error states and refresh functionality\n\nThe sidebar navigation was implemented with a purple theme matching the site design, user profile section with avatar and sign-out functionality, mobile hamburger menu with overlay, and navigation links for analytics and settings.\n\nThe existing /dashboard page was updated to use the new layout while preserving all authentication and security features from Phase D. Sample metric cards with mock data were added, content was reorganized into a modern dashboard layout, and the security panel was made collapsible for better user experience.\n\nThe server was tested and is running successfully without compilation errors, with authentication protection working correctly, components rendering without issues, and running on port 3002.\n</info added on 2025-07-29T11:53:49.981Z>",
