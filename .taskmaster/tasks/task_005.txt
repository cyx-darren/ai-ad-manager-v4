Comprehensive error handling and retry system has been implemented with the following components:

1. Custom Error Classes:
   - GA4ServiceError (base class with JSON serialization)
   - Specialized error types for authentication, quota, network, validation, timeout, cache, configuration, and data processing errors
   - Classification into retryable and non-retryable errors

2. Exponential Backoff Retry Logic:
   - RetryManager class with configurable strategies
   - Specialized retry managers for different error types
   - Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
   - Intelligent retry decision logic based on error classification
   - Custom retry delays for quota errors with retry-after header support
   - Maximum retry limits and delay caps

3. Try-Catch Integration:
   - Enhanced error handling in GA4DataClient.initialize()
   - Retry logic in getCachedData() with error classification
   - New executeGA4APICall() method for consistent API error handling
   - Updated session and user metrics methods to use the new system
   - Graceful cache error handling to prevent request blocking

4. Error Monitoring:
   - Global ErrorHandler with comprehensive statistics
   - Error tracking by type and code with recovery metrics
   - Development testing endpoints for all error types
   - Real-time error statistics endpoints

Testing confirms the system correctly handles various error scenarios with appropriate retry behavior and performance metrics show efficient error recovery with minimal impact on API requests.

## Rate Limiting and Quota Management Implementation

A comprehensive rate limiting and quota management system has been implemented with the following components:

### 1. Token Bucket Rate Limiting System
- `TokenBucketRateLimiter` class with configurable capacity and refill rates
- Exponential backoff and smooth rate limiting algorithm
- Per-category rate limiters: ga4-core-reporting (100/min), ga4-realtime (60/min), ga4-general (200/min), per-user (10/sec)
- Dynamic per-user rate limiting with automatic limiter creation
- Token refill with time-based calculations

### 2. Comprehensive Quota Tracking
- `QuotaTracker` class monitoring GA4 API quotas
- Daily quotas: 50,000 core reporting, 10,000 realtime  
- Hourly quotas: 5,000 core reporting, 1,000 realtime
- Automatic quota reset monitoring (hourly and daily)
- Real-time quota usage tracking and status monitoring

### 3. Warning and Alert System
- Configurable warning thresholds (70% yellow, 90% red)
- Automatic quota alert generation and callback system
- Real-time alert monitoring endpoints
- Status classification (ok, warning, critical)

### 4. Express Middleware Integration
- `rateLimitMiddleware` with category-specific limiting
- `quotaMonitoringMiddleware` for global quota awareness
- HTTP 429 responses with proper Retry-After headers
- Rate limit and quota headers in all responses
- Graceful middleware error handling

### 5. Monitoring and Testing Endpoints
- `/cache/rate-limits` - Real-time rate limiting status
- `/cache/quota-status` - Current quota usage and health
- `/cache/quota-alerts` - Active quota warnings and alerts
- `/cache/rate-limit-config` - System configuration details
- `/cache/rate-limit-test-dev` - Development testing endpoint
- `/cache/quota-reset-dev` - Development quota reset utility

### 6. Testing Results
- **Rate Limiting Test 1**: 10 requests with 50ms delay → 100% success (proper token consumption)
- **Rate Limiting Test 2**: 65 rapid requests → 60 allowed, 5 blocked (92% success rate, proper rate limiting activation)
- **Token Bucket Behavior**: Correct token depletion and refill rates
- **Quota Monitoring**: All quotas healthy, proper reset time calculations
- **Configuration Verification**: All limits and thresholds correctly configured

The implementation provides enterprise-grade rate limiting and quota management ensuring the GA4 service respects API limits while providing detailed monitoring and alerting capabilities.
