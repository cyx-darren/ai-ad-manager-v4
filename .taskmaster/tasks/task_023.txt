# Test Strategy:
1. Test services locally with Docker before deployment
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Test health check endpoints
4. Validate Redis connection
5. Test automatic scaling with load testing
6. Verify monitoring alerts with simulated errors
7. Test custom domain configuration
8. Validate CI/CD pipeline with sample changes
9. Test backup and restore procedures
10. Verify service communication with end-to-end tests
