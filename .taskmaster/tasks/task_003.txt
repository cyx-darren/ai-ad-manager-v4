# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Authentication System with Supabase Auth and Google OAuth
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure authentication system using Supabase Auth with Google OAuth integration to allow users to sign in with their Google accounts, which is necessary for accessing Google Analytics data.
# Details:
1. Set up Supabase Auth client in the application
2. Create Google OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
   - Create a new project in Google Cloud Console
   - Enable Google OAuth API
   - Configure OAuth consent screen
   - Create OAuth client ID with authorized redirect URIs
3. Configure Supabase Auth with Google OAuth provider
4. Create authentication UI components:
   - SignIn component
   - SignUp component
   - ForgotPassword component
   - ResetPassword component
   - Profile management component
5. Implement authentication hooks and context:
   - useAuth hook for authentication state
   - AuthProvider context for global auth state
6. Set up protected routes with authentication middleware
7. Implement token refresh logic
8. Store Google refresh tokens securely in Supabase
9. Add sign-out functionality
10. Create error handling for authentication failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Test sign-in flow with Google OAuth
2. Verify token storage and retrieval
3. Test protected routes with authenticated and unauthenticated users
4. Validate token refresh mechanism
5. Test sign-out functionality
6. Verify error handling for authentication failures
7. Test user profile management

# Subtasks:
## 1. Finalize Google OAuth Credentials and Supabase Provider Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete the setup of Google OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console, ensuring all required scopes for Google Analytics access are included, and configure the Supabase Auth provider with these credentials and correct redirect URIs.
### Details:
Verify that the OAuth consent screen is fully configured with privacy policy and terms links, and that the OAuth client ID and secret are correctly entered in the Supabase dashboard. Ensure all necessary redirect URIs are registered for both development and production environments.

## 2. Enhance and Complete Authentication UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and refine authentication UI components not yet implemented or needing enhancement, including SignUp, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, and Profile management, ensuring a consistent and secure user experience.
### Details:
Build or improve the SignUp, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, and Profile management components, integrating them with Supabase Auth and Google OAuth. Ensure accessibility, error handling, and responsive design.

## 3. Implement Secure Token Storage and Google Refresh Token Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Design and implement secure storage for Supabase and Google OAuth tokens, including handling and securely storing Google refresh tokens required for Google Analytics API access.
### Details:
Extend backend and Supabase database schema to store Google refresh tokens securely, ensuring encryption at rest and access control. Update authentication logic to capture and store tokens upon successful OAuth login.

## 4. Develop Authentication State Management and Token Refresh Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement robust authentication state management using hooks and context, and add logic to refresh Supabase and Google OAuth tokens as needed for seamless user sessions.
### Details:
Enhance or complete the useAuth hook and AuthProvider context to track authentication state, handle token expiration, and automatically refresh tokens. Integrate with UI to prompt re-authentication if refresh fails.

## 5. Integrate Protected Routes, Sign-Out, and Comprehensive Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Set up route protection using authentication middleware, implement sign-out functionality, and add comprehensive error handling for all authentication flows.
### Details:
Configure middleware to restrict access to protected routes based on authentication state. Implement sign-out logic that clears all tokens and session data. Add error handling for authentication failures, token issues, and edge cases.
