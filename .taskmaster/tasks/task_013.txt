# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Implementation Roadmap Generator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Implementation Roadmap Generator that converts recommendations into actionable tasks with step-by-step guidance and calendar integration.
# Details:
1. Design roadmap generation algorithm:
   - Convert recommendations to tasks
   - Sequence tasks based on dependencies
   - Estimate time requirements
   - Calculate potential impact
2. Create RoadmapGenerator service:
   - generateRoadmap(recommendations)
   - sequenceTasks(tasks)
   - estimateTimeRequirements(tasks)
   - calculateImpact(tasks)
3. Implement task data model in Supabase
4. Create calendar integration with Google Calendar API
5. Implement task scheduling algorithm
6. Add task dependency management
7. Create task progress tracking
8. Implement task notification system
9. Add task assignment for team members
10. Create task reporting and analytics

# Test Strategy:
1. Test roadmap generation with sample recommendations
2. Verify task sequencing with dependencies
3. Test time estimation with different task types
4. Validate impact calculation with historical data
5. Test calendar integration with Google Calendar
6. Verify task scheduling with different time constraints
7. Test dependency management with complex task relationships
8. Validate progress tracking with task updates
9. Test notification system with task deadlines
10. Verify task assignment with multiple team members
