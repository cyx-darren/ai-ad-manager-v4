# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement End-to-End Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 23, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive end-to-end tests and quality assurance processes to ensure the platform functions correctly across all features and integrations.
# Details:
1. Set up end-to-end testing framework:
   - Install Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing
   - Configure test environment with test database
   - Create test users and sample data
2. Implement core test suites:
   - Authentication flow tests
   - Dashboard functionality tests
   - Google Analytics integration tests
   - Recommendation system tests
   - Landing page analysis tests
3. Create integration tests for all services:
   - API endpoint tests
   - Database operation tests
   - Third-party integration tests
4. Implement performance testing:
   - Load testing with k6 or similar
   - Response time benchmarking
   - Database query optimization tests
5. Set up accessibility testing:
   - Automated a11y checks with axe-core
   - Keyboard navigation tests
   - Screen reader compatibility tests
6. Implement security testing:
   - Authentication and authorization tests
   - Data isolation tests
   - API security tests
7. Create visual regression tests:
   - Screenshot comparison tests
   - Responsive design tests
   - Theme switching tests
8. Set up continuous integration testing:
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Pre-deployment test runs
   - Test reporting and notifications
9. Implement user acceptance testing process:
   - Test scenarios for different user personas
   - Feature validation checklists
   - Bug reporting and tracking system
10. Create test documentation and reports

# Test Strategy:
1. Run end-to-end tests on staging environment
2. Verify all user flows work as expected
3. Test integration points with external services
4. Validate performance under various load conditions
5. Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard
6. Verify security measures with penetration testing
7. Test visual consistency across browsers and devices
8. Validate CI pipeline with test failures and successes
9. Conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders
10. Generate comprehensive test reports
